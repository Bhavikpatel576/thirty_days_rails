# README
Rails tutorial that will go over some basic association methods 
  - has_many
  - belongs_to


We'll answer some more complex questions like 
  1. How does rails know which table and foreign key to use when you associations like => User.first.orders.
  2. Why we would specify the :class_name option in association? #hint/answer: lets say we would like to call the user by event.user
